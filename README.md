A simple DirectX12 renderer build in Windows. 
The objective of this is to get used to more modern graphics pipelines and to explore writing a renderer from scratch. This helps me understand the graphics programmer pipeline to a deeper level. 

Currently I am rendering a simple rotating triangle.

Hoping to add further mesh, lighting, and shading support in the future.
